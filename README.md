# ScribbleLib

This is a library with classes I use for my personal projects. It only contains classes for PBKDF2 and logging at it's current state.

## Can I use this library for my own projects?

Sure, you can use it under the conditions of the MIT license. You can let me know what you used it for if you want to, I'm always interested in seeing the interesting things other people do.

## How can I use this library?

I will publish it on Maven Central later.
